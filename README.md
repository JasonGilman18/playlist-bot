# Playlist Bot

This project was created during TAMUmake 2021

## Description

A problem music listeners often face is branching out to find new music. By combining an easy to use platform and recommendation algorithms, the playlist bot brings a solution to this problem. By answering various questions, the application learns about the user's music needs and taste, and ultimately builds a Spotify playlist for them.
